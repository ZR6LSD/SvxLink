# ZR6LSD's Automatic SvxLink Installation Script (Echolink)

 ZR6LSD's Automatic SvxLink Installation Script for the Raspberry Pi

Requirements :
Raspberry PI (model doesn't matter)
By default my config files that are used by my script are preconfigured to use a usb sound card and serial adapter.
This can be manually changed if needed by editing ```svxlink.conf```located in ```/etc/svxlink```
Any additional configuration to Echolink can be manually changed if needed by editing ```ModuleEchoLink.conf``` located in```/etc/svxlink/svxlink.d```

The defaults usually work in 99% of cases.


# To use the Installation Script.

1. Just clone my repository on a fresh installation of raspbian.
2. cd to ```home/pi/SvxLink/``` 
3. Make the file autosvx.sh executable with ```sudo chmod +x autosvx.sh ```
4. Run the script ```./autosvx.sh```
5. Follow the prompts and answer a few questions
6. Reboot
7. Done 

# SvxLink Server

SvxLink is a project that develops software targeting the ham radio community. It started out as an EchoLink application for Linux back in 2003 but has now evolved to be something much more advanced.
The SvxLink Server is a general purpose voice services system, which when connected to a transceiver, can act as both an advanced repeater system and can also operate on a simplex channel. One could call it a radio operating system.

# Conclusion

Have fun with it! But keep in mind that I have not tested them on every other Linux distribution available and I cannot offer support to you if they don't work on yours. I would love to hear your comments and I will happily look at any suggestions for new features or code fixes but I do not have the time or inclination to run and test your modified versions, act as a beta tester or even offer useful advice if your changes are not working. I am NOT an expert; I am simply sharing tools that I use everyday.
