# SvxLink

SvxLink is a project that develops software targeting the ham radio community. It started out as an EchoLink application for Linux back in 2003 but has now evolved to be something much more advanced.

# SvxLink Server

The SvxLink Server is a general purpose voice services system, which when connected to a transceiver, can act as both an advanced repeater system and can also operate on a simplex channel. One could call it a radio operating system.
