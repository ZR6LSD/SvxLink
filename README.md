# SvxLink

SvxLink is a project that develops software targeting the ham radio community. It started out as an EchoLink application for Linux back in 2003 but has now evolved to be something much more advanced.

# SvxLink Server

The SvxLink Server is a general purpose voice services system, which when connected to a transceiver, can act as both an advanced repeater system and can also operate on a simplex channel. One could call it a radio operating system.
Conclusion

Have fun with these! But keep in mind that I have not tested them on every other Linux distribution available and I cannot offer support to you if they don't work on yours. I would love to hear your comments and I will happily look at any suggestions for new features or code fixes but I do not have the time or inclination to run and test your modified versions, act as a beta tester or even offer useful advice if your changes are not working. I am NOT an expert; I am simply sharing tools that I use everyday.
